##  <b>About Me</b> 👩🏽‍💻
<img width="200px" align="right" src=https://media.giphy.com/media/CmKNvH8b5jKyQ/giphy.gif >
I'm a Systems Engineering student at UTN-FRBA, and I'm currently halfway through my degree. Along the way, I've discovered that application development is my true passion, especially front-end, though I'm also eager to dive into back-end development.

###  <b>What I do </b> 🚀
In my free time, I love to start new projects, both to learn something new and just for fun. Each project is an opportunity to keep improving my skills and explore new technologies.

### <b>Apart from programming...<b> 🎶
I really enjoy listening to music; I can't go a day without discovering something new (or old). Also, if I have the time, I love watching movies, especially the old ones, those that have something special about them~

## <b>My goals<b>
I want to keep expanding my knowledge in back-end development and improve my full-stack skills. I also want to start experimenting with APIs and dive deeper into software architecture.
